# Frontend

Based on [BoardGame.io - Tutorial](https://boardgame.io/documentation/#/tutorial)

## Getting Started

You can serve the application TicTacToe from the command line by starting the server with:

```
$ cd containers/app/frontend
$ npm start
```

Although we havenâ€™t built any UI yet, boardgame.io renders a Debug Panel. This panel means we can already play our Tic-Tac-Toe game!
